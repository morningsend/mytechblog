### Who am I?
My name is Zaiyang Li (李载阳). I am a student living in Bristol, England, which you might have heard of. I love coding, watching anime and cooking. Before becoming a software engineer, I was a chef for 2 years.

### What do I do?
Masters computer science student, I am about to graduate and get a degree and start my first full-time job as a software engineer. Challenging as it is, coding has been a hobby since 15. Turning hobby into a career means work for me is play.
