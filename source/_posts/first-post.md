### Hello and Welcome!

I decided to start a blog to dump my brain. I hope like-minded might find it useful for these posts to be of value.

### What will you write about?

This blog will be mainly about current trending topics in software engineering. There will be tutorials, commentaries, etc.

### How often are you going to update it?
I am fairly new to blogging, which means I will aim to update the blog less often. New post will be updated each month. When I have gain more experience in both blogging and engineer, I will be able to  write more content.


#### Best of Luck!
